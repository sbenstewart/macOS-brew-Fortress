Description:     Convert adblock config files to privoxy format
 AdBlock Plus browser plugin has great block list files provided by big community,
 but it is client software and cannot work on a server as proxy.
 .
 Privoxy proxy has good potential to block ads at server side,
 but it experiences acute shortage of updated block lists.
 .
 This software converts adblock lists to privoxy config files format.
 .
 Almost all adblock features are supported including
 .
 * block/unblock requests (on privoxy)
 .
 all syntax features are supported except for regex templates matching host name
 .
 * hide/unhide page elements (via CSS)
 .
 all syntax features are supported
 .
 * all block request options except for outdated ones:
 .
 Supported: script, image, stylesheet, object, xmlhttprequest, object-subrequest, subdocument,
 document, elemhide, other, popup, third-party, domain=..., match-case, donottrack
 .
 Unsupported: collapse, background, xbl, ping and dtd
